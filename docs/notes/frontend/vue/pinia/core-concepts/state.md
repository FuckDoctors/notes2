# State

The state is, most of the time, the central part of your store.
In Pinia the state is **defined as a function that returns the initial state**.

```js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

const useStore = defineStore('storeId', {
  // arrow function recommended for full type inference
  state: () => {
    return {
      // all these properties will have their type inferred automatically
      counter: 0,
      name: 'Eduardo',
      isAdmin: true,
    }
  },
})
```

::: tip
If you are using Vue 2, the data you create in state follows the same rules as the data in a Vue instance,
ie the state object must be plain and you need to call `Vue.set()` when adding new properties to it.
See also: [Vue#data](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/api/#data).
:::

## Accessing the `state`

By default, you can directly read and write to the state by accessing it through the `store` instance:

```js
const store = useStore()
store.counter++
```

## Resetting the state

You can _reset_ the state to its initial value by calling the `$reset()` method on the store:

```js
const store = useStore()
store.$reset()
```

## Usage with the Options API

```js
// src/stores/counterStore.js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

const useCounterStore = defineStore('counterStore', {
  state: () => ({
    counter: 0,
  }),
})
```

If you are not using the Composition API, and you are using `computed`, `methods`, ...,
you can use the `mapState()` helper to map state properties as readonly computed properties:

```js
import { mapState } from 'pinia'
import { useCounterStore } from '@/stores/counterStore'

export default {
  computed: {
    // gives access to this.counter inside the component
    // same as reading from store.counter
    ...mapState(useCounterStore, ['counter']),
    // same as above but registers is as this.myOwnName
    ...mapState(useCounterStore, {
      myOwnName: 'counter',
      // you can also write a function that gets access to the store
      double: store => store.counter * 2,
      // it can have access to `this` but it won't be typed correctlly
      magicValue(store) {
        return store.someGetter + this.counter + this.double
      },
    }),
  },
}
```

### Modifiable state

If you want to be able to write to these state properties (e.g. if you have a form),
you can use `mapWritableState()` instead.
Note you cannot pass a function like with `mapState()`:

```js
import { mapWritableState } from 'pinia'
import { useCounterStore } from '../stores/counterStore'

export default {
  computed: {
    // gives access to this.counter inside the component and allows setting it
    // this.counter++
    // same as reading from store.counter
    ...mapWritableState(useCounterStore, ['counter'])
    // same as above but registers it as this.myOwnName
    ...mapWritableState(useCounterStore, {
      myOwnName: 'counter',
    }),
  },
}
```

::: tip
You don't need `mapWritableState()` for collections like arrays unless you are replacing the whole array with cartItems = [],
`mapState()` still allows you to call methods on your collections.

::: playground#vue Usage with the Options API

@file App.vue

```vue
<script>
import { mapState, mapStores, mapActions, mapWritableState } from 'pinia'
import { useCounterStore } from './counterStore.js'

export default {
  computed: {
    ...mapStores(useCounterStore),
    ...mapWritableState(useCounterStore, ['count']),
    ...mapState(useCounterStore, ['doubleCount']),
    ...mapWritableState(useCounterStore, {
      myCounter: 'count',
    }),
  },
  methods: {
    ...mapActions(useCounterStore, ['increment']),
  },
}
</script>

<template>
  <div>Counter: {{ count }}</div>
  <div>MyCounter: {{ myCounter }}</div>
  <div>Double count: {{ doubleCount }}</div>
  <div>Change counter: <input type="number" v-model.number="count" /></div>
  <button @click="increment">increment</button>
  <button @click="counterStore.$reset()">reset</button>
</template>
```

@file counterStore.js

```js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export const useCounterStore = defineStore('counter', {
  state: () => ({
    count: 0,
  }),
  getters: {
    doubleCount: state => state.count * 2,
  },
  actions: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    },
  },
})
```

@setting

```json
{
  "service": "https://sfc.zhaobc.site"
}
```

## Mutating the state

Apart from directly mutating the store with store.counter++, you can also call the `$patch` method.
It allows you to apply multiple changes at the same time with a partial state object:

```js
store.$patch({
  counter: store.counter + 1,
  name: 'zhaobc',
})
```

However, some mutations are really hard or costly to apply with this syntax: any collection modification
(e.g. pushing, removing, splicing an element from an array) requires you to create a new collection.
Because of this, the `$patch` method also accepts a function to group this kind of mutations that are difficult to apply with a patch object:

```js
cartStore.$patch(state => {
  state.items.push({
    name: 'shoes',
    quantity: 1,
  })
  state.hasChanged = true
})
```

## Replacing the state

You can replace the whole state of a store by setting its `$state` property to a new object:

```js
store.$state = {
  counter: 666,
  name: 'zhaobc',
}
```

You can also replace the whole state of your application by changing the state of the pinia instance:

```js
pinia.state.value = {}
```

## Subscribing to the state

You can watch the state and its changes through the `$subscribe()` method of a store, similar to Vuex's subscribe method.

The advantage of using `$subscribe()` over a regular `watch()` is that subscriptions will trigger only **once** after patches (e.g. when using the function version from above).

```js
cartStore.$subscribe((mutation, state) => {
  // import { MutationType } from 'pinia'
  mutation.type // 'direct' | 'patch object' | 'patch function'
  mutation.storeId // cart
  mutation.payload // patch object passed to cartStore.$patch

  // persist the whole state to the local storage whenever it changes
  localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(state))
})
```

By default, state subscriptions are bound to the component where they are added (if the store is inside a component's `setup()`).
Meaning, they will be automatically removed when the component is unmounted.

If you want to keep them after the component is unmounted,
pass `{ detached: true }` as the second argument to detach the state subscription from the current component:

```js
export default {
  setup() {
    const someState = useSomeStore()

    // this subscription will be kept after the component is unmounted
    someStore.$subscribe(callback, { detached: true })
  },
}
```

You can watch the whole state on the pinia instance:

```js
watch(
  pinia.state,
  state => {
    // persist the whole state to the local storage whenever it changes
    localStorage.setItem('piniaState', JSON.stringify(state))
  },
  {
    deep: true,
  }
)
```
